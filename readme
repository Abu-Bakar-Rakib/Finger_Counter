This is a real-time finger counter that detects and counts the number of fingers shown in front of the camera using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.
📌 Features:
1.Real-time hand tracking and finger counting
2.Uses OpenCV for image processing
3.Utilizes MediaPipe’s Hand Tracking model
4.Simple and efficient implementation
5.Press 'q' to exit the application

🛠️ Technologies Used
1.Python
2.OpenCV (for image processing)
3.MediaPipe (for hand tracking)
             
🚀 Installation & Setup:
  #Install dependencies:
 1.Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then install the required libraries: pip install opencv-python mediapipe

2.Run the program: python finger_counter.py
